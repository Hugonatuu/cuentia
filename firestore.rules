/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-generated content
 * (stories, characters), ensuring that only the authenticated user who created
 * the content can modify or delete it. Public read access is granted where
 * appropriate (e.g., predefined characters, community stories).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.  Only the user can write
 *   to their own profile.  Read access is public.
 * - /users/{userId}/stories/{storyId}: Stores stories created by the user.
 *   Only the user can manage their own stories.
 * - /users/{userId}/characters/{characterId}: Stores characters created by the user.
 *   Only the user can manage their own characters.
 * - /users/{userId}/checkout_sessions/{sessionId}: Stores Stripe checkout sessions.
 *   Only the user can create and read their own checkout sessions.
 * - /subscriptions/{subscriptionId}: Stores subscription plans. Read access is
 *   public, write access is restricted.
 * - /predefinedCharacters/{characterId}: Stores predefined characters. Read
 *   access is public, write access is restricted.
 * - /communityStories/{storyId}: Stores community stories. Read access is
 *   public, write access is restricted.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data and their associated
 *   stories and characters.
 * - Listing of user profiles is implicitly denied via the security rules structure.
 * - Subscription plans, predefined characters, and community stories are
 *   publicly readable but not writable by end-users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Stories and characters are stored under the user's document. To create simpler, more performant rules, denormalize (copy) data required for an authorization decision directly onto the documents being secured.
